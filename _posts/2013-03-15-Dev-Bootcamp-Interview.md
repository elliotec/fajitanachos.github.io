The first interview
-------------------

I applied to Dev Bootcamp in January. The day after I applied, I received an email to set up a time to interview. Sweet. The first available time slot was a month away, but I already had plans for that day. I ended up snagging a spot on March 5th, a little over 6 weeks later. I can be no patient. No worries.

February flew by and my interview arrived shortly thereafter. I was pumped. The interview was set for 2:00pm PST which was 7 am the next day for me. I woke up at 5:30 to make sure everything was in order and working properly. I decided to use my wife's computer as my webcam occasionally decides to give me the middle finger and not cooperate.

The appointed time rolled around and I found myself staring at Karim Bishay on the other end. A quick hello, how are you, and we were off. We started with questions from me. The ones I had prepared all of a sudden seemed ridiculous (although they really weren't). I picked a select few and decided to skip the rest.  After that, he gave me a puzzle to work through. I had read on a few other blogs that the interview involved a puzzle, but I didn't have any idea what kind. The exact question doesn't matter, so I won't share it here. It's more about your thought process. I got to the right answer with a few nudges from Karim, but in hindsight I definitely should have done better. Just nerves I guess.

Next, Karim typed a short code snippet into the Skype chat box and asked me to take a look at it. However, due to a combination of said nerves and being on a different computer, I couldn't get the chat box to show right away.

"Bear with me a second, I'm using my wife's computer and can't pull up the message." I said, later realizing how dumb it sounded.

He kindly reminded me that I could click on the bubble next to his name. You know, the spot where it notifies you in bright orange when someone has entered a message. Oops.

The code snippet itself wasn't difficult. It was the first time I had ever analyzed a piece of code with/for someone. I knew the answer, but should have been more confident in expressing it. Again, I think it was more about the thought process.

At the end we talked about a few other things and he recommended that I work through a Ruby tutorial to get a feel for things.

Total time: 15 minutes.

The second interview
--------------------

After I completed the tutorial, I received an email to schedule a second interview. I'm excited. There was an opening the following week and I jumped on it. That interview was today. Well, it was supposed to be.

>Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment.

That's Finagle's corollary to [Murphy's Law][1], and I know it's cliche. I wouldn't even bring it up if it didn't *perfectly* describe the situation in my apartment this morning. Short of a natural disaster, everything that could go wrong, did, and at the worst possible moment.

20 minutes before the interview was scheduled to start, I fired up my computer and tried to log into Skype. I couldn't connect. I tried my email next and quickly realized that our internet connection had gone south.

"Tell me this isn't happening..."

The wifi goes out in our apartment on a semi-regular basis. I went back and forth with our internet provider when we first moved in but it didn't help. Switching providers isn't an option either. When it happens, I can usually get online with a wired connection. Not today though. I can recall that happening two times in the last year. Today makes #3. With time dwindling, I frantically tried to reset the router and modem. I also restarted my computer and, low and behold, it was time for a Windows update.

Nice.

As our scheduled start time neared, and a solid internet connection was still no where to be found, I turned to plan B. My phone. I logged in to the Skype app, tried to shake the past 15 minutes off, and resolved to do my best under the circumstances.

A few minutes later, the call came in. I accepted, and the Skype app instantly crashed. Wtf, really? I opened it back up and found a message from Karim.

"Are you there?"

I told him I was having some internet problems and I was on my phone. He replied, asking me to give him a call on his number. I tried calling his number from Skype, but I needed to have Skype credits. No time to add them and making a 15-20 minute regular long distance call to SF isn't cheap. I resorted to calling him from Google Talk. Two rings and he answered. A glimmer of hope. I finished my first sentence when he replied

"Sorry, Andrew. I can barely hear you." 

I asked him if we could give Skype another shot. A last and desperate attempt. We got connected. I could hear him on the other end. Another glimmer of hope.

"Hello? Andrew? You there?"  But he couldn't see or hear me. Game over.

He sent me a nice message suggesting we reschedule for another day. I apologized for wasting his time and he sent back a reassuring message that everything was ok. At that point there was nothing more I could do.

As you might surmise, my internet connection came back to life 5 minutes after we decided to reschedule. Go figure. Sometimes these things just happen. I've rescheduled the interview for April 5th. I've also purchased plenty of Skype credits to call him, should things go haywire again. 

I'll let you know how it turns out.
