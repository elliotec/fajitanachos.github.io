We all know the saying. 

"Jack of all trades, master of none."

We're told to focus. Focus on one thing and do it really well. That's solid advice. If you can become a master of one field, an expert in one niche, you'll be set. You'll be the go to guy for X. I know it works exceptionally well for some people. 

But I'm not one of them. 

3 months ago I had never written anything in plain Javascript. Hello [hotfix][1]. At one point I was using WordPress to run this site. Hi [Quick-Preview][2]. After a while, I moved on. Meet my new friends [Jekyll][3] and [GitHub Pages][4]. 

I enoy trying new things. You have a new API out? Sure, I'll ping it. I haven't run my own server before, but we should all have a little sys admin in us, right? Front end to back end, I love it all. I like stepping outside my comfort zone. If we aren't constantly pushing ourselves to learn new things, then we are doing ourselves a huge disservice. Some people people will say I spread myself too thin. How can we become proficient at something if we are always trying new things? I don't know, but I'm doing it. I'm leaps and bounds ahead of where I was 6 months ago, and 6 months from now I'll know even more about things that I know nothing about today.    

The tools we use are always changing. We should change with them. 

I'm Jack. Nice to meet you.
