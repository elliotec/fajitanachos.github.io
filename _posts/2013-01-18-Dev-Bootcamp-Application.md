I just submitted my Dev Bootcamp application!  If you don't know what the 
Dev Bootcamp program is, head over [here] [1] and take a look.

I'm hoping to make a strong case, and with a little luck, get accepted into one 
of the fall/winter 2013 cohorts. It's a big investment though. I'm sure most 
applicants have thought to themselves "What if I shell out $12k and don't get a 
job after the program is over?"  I know I have. But that's a risk I'm willing to 
take. This is an opportunity for me to exponentially increase how much I know 
about web development, meet some amazing people, and hopefully land a job as a 
developer after it's all said and done. Yeah, I'm willing to take that risk.

So, about the application. As of now, it consists of two parts. The first part 
is a series of questions about you, your background, and why you want to join 
Dev Bootcamp. For the second part they ask you to submit a video in which you  
A) tell a little about yourself and B) teach them something. Technically, the 
video part is optional. That being said, it would be crazy not to submit one 
when they tell you that it "definitely helps".

I don't know how Dev Bootcamp feels about me posting all the application 
questions (although anyone can sign up and see them) so I'll just tell you 
about one question that I had a little trouble with. I changed my answer to 
this 3 or 4 times and eventually settled on this.

Q: "Tell us something surprising or amusing that you have discovered."

A: "Never tell a restaurant in Thailand that you "like spicy"...

Quick back story: We went to Thailand and Malaysia over the Christmas holidays. 
One night we were at a restaurant and I asked if a dish was spicy. The server 
tilted her head to the side and said "a little spicy". Well, I like spicy food 
and I was afraid that by asking they would think I wanted them to make it not s
picy. So I answered with a big smile and said "I like spicy". Bad idea. Two bies in,
I was crying, sweating, and cursing myself all at the same time. I'm no stranger 
to spicy food. I had a habanero plant one summer and I enjoyed it immensely. But 
damn, that was some serious heat and I paid for it.

Anyway, on to the video.

The video was shot over two days. I went to Kyoto to film the first part with a 
friend. We went to Nanzen-ji Temple which is a great spot. If you are ever in 
Kyoto, it's worth checking out. My wife helped me film the second part in our 
apartment and at a restaurant down the street. We got there early and the place 
was pretty empty. I wanted to stay and catch more of the vibe but when every 
take you do costs you a beer, it can get expensive.

Here's the video.

Now, my friends, we wait.
