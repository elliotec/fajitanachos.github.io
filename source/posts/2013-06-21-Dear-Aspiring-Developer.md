It doesn't matter what you did in a previous life. What matters is what you do today, and every day going forward. You want to be a developer. Cool. 

Why? 

Because it pays well? Because you want to work at a start up? Because your mom said you are good at the interwebs? This isn't going to be easy. This is about busting your ass to get where you want to be. I certainly don't know everything, but as someone who is on the same path, here are four things I think you should do.


Number One
-----------

If you don't have a project you're currently working on, you should really find one. There will never be a magic time or place to get started. Today is better than tomorrow, which is better than the next day. It's fine to start with a tutorial or a book, but you'll learn a lot more from working on something that you are passionate about. Can't find an idea? You're probably not looking hard enough. Open your eyes and view every potential problem, inconvenience, or desire through the lens of it being your next project. Have an idea languishing in the back of your mind? Build it. I don't care if it sucks. One shitty project is infinitely better than zero projects. If you aren't actively working on something, anything, then you are doing yourself a huge disservice. 

Number Two
-----------

You should to be writing code *every single day*. 

The only two days I'm not writing code are my wife's birthday and our anniversary. That's it. If you aren't in your text editor, making sweet passionate love to your keyboard day in and day out, then you're doing it wrong. Every day you will get a little better. You'll look back on things you did three months ago and cringe because you've gotten so much better. There will be small triumphs along the way, like when things [just work][1], and rest assured there will also be many failures. You'll need to fight through the frustration, tediousness, and problems that you encounter along the way. And hopefully you'll love doing it. 

Number Three
------------

You need a blog, no questions asked. I waited 9 months before I started this blog. That was a mistake. My reasoning was that I didn't have anything to say. That was a pretty poor reason. You can write about your latest projects, things you've learned, or anything else that comes to mind. In fact, if you don't already have a project you are working on, a blog is the perfect starter project. Spend some time thinking about the layout you want to use and then go build it. It took me too long to realize that it's really not so much about what you write. Your blog/portfolio is your calling card. It's the perfect opportunity to tell your story, and no one else is going to tell it for you. Tell me a story. 

Number Four
------------

Join [GitHub][2], write some code, and put it out there for the world to see. Forget about contributing to open source projects for now. There will come a time and place for that. Just get started with whatever you are working on. At first, you won't understand why you even need version control. In time though, you'll come to wonder how you ever lived without it. You can use git by itself, but GitHub makes it easier to manage and it's the perfect platform for you to show others that you can, in fact, write code. As time goes on you'll come across open source projects that pique your interest. When you do, take some time to contribute to them.
