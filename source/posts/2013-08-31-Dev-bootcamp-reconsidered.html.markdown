meta-description: "Why I'm not doing Dev Bootcamp"
---

In January of 2013, I applied to Dev Bootcamp. To make a [long story](http://fajitanachos.com/Dev-Bootcamp) short, I've been accepted into the October 7th cohort. It's a great opportunity for me to become a full-time developer, but two weeks ago I decided not to attend.

Why Dev Bootcamp?
-----------------

When I first applied to Dev Bootcamp, I had [one project](https://github.com/FajitaNachos/Quick-Preview) under my belt, and this blog was only a few months old. I didn't know very much, but I knew I liked what I was doing. I would write some code, break something, Google it, and learn about it. Rinse and repeat. My initial thoughts about Dev Bootcamp were something along the lines of this: 

"I'll go in as a beginner, come out with some chops, and then maybe I can get a job." 

Dev Bootcamp started the programming bootcamp movement. It's the most reputable, well-established program out there and I applied there for one reason: to get a job.

Why not Dev Bootcamp?
---------------------

I've come a long way from the day I first applied, and I'll be the first to admit that I still have a lot to learn. Despite that, I'm leaps and bounds ahead of where I was when I started. I've been doing this, day in and day out, for the last 14 months. Before that, I had made a couple of one-off websites. I think the optimal time for me to go through the program was probably 9 months ago. I'm sure I would still learn a lot, but the risk/reward has shifted in favor of me going forward on my own. 


What are my options, Doc?
----------------------------------

I've already paid the 11k. $1,000 of which is a non-refundable deposit. I'm budgeting $3,000 a month for living expenses (for two people). I've never lived in San Francisco, but for two people I think that's fair.

### Option 1

Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week program (with an optional 3 weeks at the end). I can realistically expect it to take anywhere from 3 to 12 weeks to find a job after the program is over. Living expenses + tuition add up to $17,000 on the low end and $26,000 on the higher side of things. The latter part of that scenario isn't pretty. 


### Option 2

I don't go through Dev Bootcamp, and I find a job on my own. I'll get $10,000 back from Dev Bootcamp, which I'll use to pay for two months worth of living expenses in San Francisco. The total cost is a much more reasonable $6,000, plus the nine weeks of time. I think I've learned enough over the last 14 months to get a job as an entry level developer. If I'm wrong, I'll be out 6k and I'll know I gave it my best shot. Then I'll pack my bags, head for the mountains, and become a ski bum (who codes nights and weekends). 

Just kidding...kinda. 

Three Things I Know and Two I Don't
----------------------------------

### Things I know going forward:

I love to learn, and I'm constantly striving to become a better developer. Day in. Day out. 

I've been writing code every day for over a year. I can count on two hands how many days have gone by where I haven't written a single line of code. 

I need a job.


### Things I don't know:

If anyone wants to hire me. 

Lots more stuff. 


A Word on Bootcamps in General
---------------
To my knowledge, Dev Bootcamp was the first bootcamp-style immersive program. A few students from their first cohort ended up starting their own schools. Now, there's a programming bootcamp coming to every major city near you. They're popping up everywhere. 

There's a whole movement for people learning to code. I think people should learn to code, if only so they have a better understanding of how things work. I avidly believe that coding should be taught in schools, starting in elementary. But, just because it's taught in schools doesn't mean we all need to become programmers. Math is taught in school but I don't want to be a mathematician. I can write, but that doesn't mean I want to be a writer. Someone can learn to code, but that doesn't mean they want/need/have to be a programmer. 

This next part is pure speculation: I think the percentage of people graduating from these programs and getting jobs is probably dropping. Dev Bootcamp put up some amazing numbers last year, but they haven't released any since then. I honestly hope they've just switched to only reporting yearly job placement rates, and 85% of their students are still scoring jobs. I want them to succeed. I'm less concerned about Dev Bootcamp than I am about some of the schools that came after them. I can't help but think a lot of these other programs are just looking to ride the wave, take in the tuition, and crank out students who may or may not be adequately prepared. 

What's next?
-------------
 
I don't know. We've rented an apartment in San Francisco for the month of October. If we like it there, we'll stay longer. If we don't, then the options are limitless. I couldn't say that before.

See you in San Francisco.
