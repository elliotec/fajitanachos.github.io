Right now, I'm on a train, riding backwards, en route to Kyoto. It's about an hour journey all in. This morning, I started working on a user authentication system using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise]). Now, I'm reading through the devise documententation and trying to make everything fit together. It's Friday night, and I'm sifting through documentation on a Rails gem...and I'm loving it. 

Did you know that trains in Japan are quieter than most libraries in the U.S.? I shit you not. I can see 4 people sleeping, 3 people staring at their phones, two listening to music, and another staring out the window. I haven't heard a single word in the last 20 minutes, save the train conductor over the intercom announcing the stops in a soothing voice, that borders on a whisper. 

"Otsu, Otsu desu."

It's times like this when it hits me. That I was meant to be a developer. When we get to Kyoto, I'll go have a nice dinner with my wife. Then, tomorrow morning, I'll get up early and get right back to it. I love doing this, day in and day out.
