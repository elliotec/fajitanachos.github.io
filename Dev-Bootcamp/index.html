<h2>The Application - January 18, 2013</h2>

<p>I just submitted my Dev Bootcamp application! If you don&#39;t know what
<a title="Dev Bootcamp" href="http://www.devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, click on that link and have a look around.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping to make a strong case, and with a little luck, get accepted into one 
of the fall/winter 2013 cohorts. I&#39;m sure most 
applicants have thought to themselves &quot;What if I shell out $12k and don&#39;t get a 
job after the program is over...?&quot;  I know I have. But that&#39;s a risk I&#39;m willing to 
take. This is an opportunity for me to exponentially increase how much I know 
about web development, meet some amazing people, and hopefully land a job as a 
developer after it&#39;s all said and done. </p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m willing to take that risk.</p>

<p>So, about the application. As of now, it consists of two parts. The first part is a series of questions about you, your background, and why you want to join Dev Bootcamp. For the second part they ask you to submit a video in which you A) tell a little about yourself and B) teach them something.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how Dev Bootcamp feels about me going through the full application (although anyone can sign up and see it) so I&#39;ll just tell you about one question. I changed my answer to this 3 or 4 times and eventually settled on this.</p>

<p>Q: &quot;Tell us something surprising or amusing that you have discovered.&quot;</p>

<p>A: &quot;Never tell a restaurant in Thailand that you &quot;like spicy&quot;...</p>

<p>Quick back story: We went to Thailand and Malaysia over the Christmas holidays. Thai food is all around pretty amazing. One night we were at a restaurant and I asked our server if a dish was spicy. The server 
cocked her head to the side and said &quot;a little spicy&quot;. Well, I like spicy food 
and I didn&#39;t want them to think otherwise. So, nodding my head with a big smile, I said &quot;I like spicy.&quot; Bad idea. Two bites in I was crying, sweating, and cursing myself all at the same time. </p>

<p>Anyway, on to the video.</p>

<p>The video was shot over two days. I went to Kyoto to film the first part with a 
friend. We went to Nanzen-ji Temple which is a great little spot. If you are ever in 
Kyoto, it&#39;s worth checking out. My wife helped me film the second part in our 
apartment and at a restaurant down the street. We got there early and the place 
was pretty empty. I wanted to stay and catch more of the vibe but when every 
take you do costs you a beer, it gets expensive.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the video.</p>

<h2>The First Interview - March 15th, 2013</h2>

<p>I applied to Dev Bootcamp in January of 2013. The day after I applied, I received an email to set up a time to interview. Sweet. The first available time slot was a month away, but unfotunately I had already made plans for that day. I ended up snagging a spot on March 5th, a little over 6 weeks later. I can be patient. No worries.</p>

<p>February flew by and my interview arrived shortly thereafter. I was pumped. The interview was set for 2:00pm PST which was 7 am the next day for me. I woke up at 5:30 to make sure everything was in order and working properly. I decided to use my wife&#39;s computer as my webcam occasionally decides to give me the middle finger and not cooperate.</p>

<p>The appointed time rolled around and I found myself staring at Karim Bishay on the other end. A quick hello, how are you, and we were off. We started with questions from me. The ones I had prepared all of a sudden seemed ridiculous. They weren&#39;t. I picked a select few and decided to skip the rest.  Next, Karim gave me a puzzle to work through. The exact question doesn&#39;t matter, so I won&#39;t share it here. He was more interested in my thought process than the actual solution. I made my way around to the right answer after a few nudges from Karim, but in hindsight I definitely should have done better. Just nerves I guess.</p>

<p>Next, Karim typed a short code snippet into the Skype chat box and asked me to take a look at it. </p>

<p>&quot;Bear with me a second, I&#39;m using my wife&#39;s computer and can&#39;t pull up the message.&quot; I said, later realizing how dumb it sounded.</p>

<p>He kindly reminded me that I could click on the bubble next to his name. You know, the spot where it notifies you in bright orange when someone has entered a message. Oops.</p>

<p>The code snippet itself wasn&#39;t difficult. It was the first time I had ever analyzed a piece of code with/for someone. I knew the answer, but I should have been more confident in expressing it.</p>

<p>At the end we talked about a few other things and he recommended that I work through a Ruby tutorial to get a feel for things.</p>

<p>Total time: 20 minutes</p>

<h2>The Second Interview - March 15, 2013</h2>

<p>After I completed the tutorial, I received an email to schedule a second interview. There was an opening the following week and I jumped on it. That interview was today. Well, it was supposed to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s Finagle&#39;s corollary to [Murphy&#39;s Law][1], and I know it&#39;s cliche. I wouldn&#39;t even bring it up if it didn&#39;t <em>perfectly</em> describe the situation in my apartment this morning. Short of a natural disaster, everything that could go wrong, did, and at the worst possible moment.</p>

<p>20 minutes before the interview was scheduled to start, I fired up my computer and tried to log into Skype. I couldn&#39;t connect. I tried my email next and quickly realized that our internet connection had gone south.</p>

<p>&quot;Not now..&quot;</p>

<p>The wifi in our apartment goes out on a semi-regular basis. I went back and forth with our internet provider when we first moved in but it didn&#39;t help. Switching providers isn&#39;t an option either. When it happens, I can usually get online with a wired connection. Not today though. I can recall that happening two times in the last year. Today makes #3. With time dwindling, I frantically tried to reset the router and modem. </p>

<p>As our scheduled start time neared, and a solid internet connection was still no where to be found, I turned to plan B. My phone. I logged in to the Skype app and tried to shake the past 15 minutes off.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the call came in. I accepted, and the Skype app instantly crashed.</p>

<p>Solid.</p>

<p>I opened it back up and found a message from Karim.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you there?&quot;</p>

<p>I told him I was having some internet problems and I was on my phone. He replied, asking me to give him a call on his number. I tried calling his number from Skype, but I needed to have Skype credits. No dice, and making a 15-20 minute regular long distance call to SF isn&#39;t cheap. I resorted to calling him from Google Talk. Two rings and he answered. A glimmer of hope. I finished my first sentence.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Andrew. I can barely hear you.&quot; </p>

<p>I asked him if we could give Skype another shot. A last and desperate attempt. We got connected. I could hear him on the other end. </p>

<p>&quot;Hello? Andrew? You there?&quot;  He couldn&#39;t see or hear me. Game over.</p>

<p>He sent me a nice message suggesting we reschedule for another day. I apologized for wasting his time and he sent back a reassuring message that everything was ok. At that point there was nothing more I could do.</p>

<p>As you might surmise, my internet connection came back to life 5 minutes after we decided to reschedule. Go figure. Sometimes these things just happen. We&#39;ve rescheduled the interview for April 5th. I&#39;ve also purchased plenty of Skype credits to call him, should things go awry again. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you know how it turns out.</p>

<h2>The Real Second Interview - April 5th, 2013</h2>

<p>The night before my second interview, I resolved to make sure that things would go smoother than my last attempt. The interview was set for 7:30am, my time. I woke up at 5:30 to make sure our internet was cooperating and I didn&#39;t need to come up with a back up plan. Fortunately, things went off without a hitch. </p>

<p>The call from Karim came in a few minutes early and what I thought was just going to be a &#39;fit&#39; interview, was not. He asked me if I had any questions. I asked a few that I had skipped over in the previous interview, and then we dove into 3 or 4 small code snippets. I stumbled to express myself clearly one spot, but after I settled down, things went fine. I was a little surprised there weren&#39;t any questions about me or my background. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same for all interviews or that is just how mine went. </p>

<p>Total time: 15 minutes</p>

<h2>The Result - April 5th, 2013</h2>

<p>Throughout the application process, I felt fairly confident about my application. I can&#39;t say that is the norm for me. Six hours after I applied, a new message from Karim popped in my inbox. My confidence wavered a bit. </p>

<p>No worries though, we&#39;re San Francisco bound! I paid my deposit and was promptly placed in the October 2013 cohort. I can&#39;t wait to meet my fellow aspiring devs. It&#39;s going to be a great ride.</p>

<p>Now, about that $12k...</p>

<h2>Update - September 2013</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve decided not to attend Dev Bootcamp. I don&#39;t know whether I made the right decision or not. We&#39;ll find out soon enough though. You can read about it <a href="http://fajitanachos.com/Dev-bootcamp-reconsidered/">here</a></p>
