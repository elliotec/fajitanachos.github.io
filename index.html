		<p>
			I was a stockbroker for two years after I graduated from college. Gradually, I realized that I didn’t enjoy what I was doing. At that time, my wife and I were 25, we didn't have anything tying us down, and moving to Japan sounded pretty awesome. So we did.
		</p>

			After a few months here and some soul searching on what I wanted to do with my life, I decided to pursue something I really enjoy, web development. Now, I’m teaching English full-time while learning as much as I can at night and on the weekends. I’m loving it.
