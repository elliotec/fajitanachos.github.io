  		<h2>Hi, I'm Andrew. </h2>
  		<p>
	  		I love mexican food, snowboarding, and fixing things when they break. My latest project is called hotfix. If you're looking for an honest, hard working, love-to-learn type of developer, you've found him.

 		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I was a stockbroker for two years after I graduated from college. Gradually, I realized that I didn’t enjoy what I was doing. At that time, my wife and I were 25, we didn't have anything tying us down, and moving to Japan sounded pretty awesome. So we did.
		</p>	
		<p>
			After a few months here and a little soul searching, I decided to pursue something I really enjoy. Web development. Now, I’m teaching English full-time while learning as much as I can at night and on the weekends. I’m loving it.
