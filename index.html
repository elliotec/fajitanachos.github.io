 			<h2>A Little History</h2>
 		</span>
		<p>
			I was a stockbroker for two years after I graduated from college. Gradually, I realized that I didn’t enjoy what I was doing. At the time, I didn’t know what I wanted to do next. My wife and I were 25. We didn't have anything tying us down and moving to Japan sounded pretty awesome. So we did.
		</p>	
			After a few months here and some soul searching on what I wanted to do with my life, I decided to pursue something I really enjoy, web development.  I’ve made a few web sites and done a little programming in the past, but I'm ready to take it to the next level. Now, I’m teaching English full-time while learning as much as I can at night and on the weekends. I’m loving it.

	  		I love mexican food, snowboarding, and fixing things when they break. My latest project is called hotfix and if you happen to be looking for a hard working, honest, love-to-learn type of developer, I'm your guy.
