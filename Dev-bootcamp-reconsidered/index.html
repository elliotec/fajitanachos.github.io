      	<h1 id = "post-title">Dev Bootcamp, Reconsidered</h1>
        <div id = "post-content">
           <p>In January of 2013, I applied to Dev Bootcamp. To make a <a href="http://fajitanachos.com/Dev-Bootcamp">long story</a> short, I&#39;ve been accepted into the October 7th cohort. It&#39;s a great opportunity for me to become a full-time developer, but two weeks ago I decided not to attend.</p>

<h2>Why Dev Bootcamp?</h2>

<p>When I first applied to Dev Bootcamp, I had <a href="https://github.com/FajitaNachos/Quick-Preview">one project</a> under my belt, and this blog was only a few months old. I didn&#39;t know very much, but I knew I liked what I was doing. I would write some code, break something, Google it, and learn about it. Rinse and repeat. My initial thoughts about Dev Bootcamp were something along the lines of this: </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll go in as a beginner, come out with some chops, and then maybe I can get a job.&quot; </p>

<p>Dev Bootcamp started the programming bootcamp movement. It&#39;s the most reputable, well-established program out there and I applied there for one reason: to get a job.</p>

<h2>Why not Dev Bootcamp?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve come a long way from the day I first applied, and I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I still have a lot to learn. Despite that, I&#39;m leaps and bounds ahead of where I was when I started. I&#39;ve been doing this, day in and day out, for the last 14 months. Before that, I had made a couple of one-off websites. I think the optimal time for me to go through the program was probably 9 months ago. I&#39;m sure I would still learn a lot, but the risk/reward has shifted in favor of me going forward on my own. </p>

<h2>What are my options, Doc?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve already paid the 11k. $1,000 of which is a non-refundable deposit. I&#39;m budgeting $3,000 a month for living expenses (for two people). I&#39;ve never lived in San Francisco, but for two people I think that&#39;s fair.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is a 9 week program (with an optional 3 weeks at the end). I can realistically expect it to take anywhere from 3 to 12 weeks to find a job after the program is over. Living expenses + tuition add up to $17,000 on the low end and $26,000 on the higher side of things. The latter part of that scenario isn&#39;t pretty. </p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t go through Dev Bootcamp, and I find a job on my own. I&#39;ll get $10,000 back from Dev Bootcamp, which I&#39;ll use to pay for two months worth of living expenses in San Francisco. The total cost is a much more reasonable $6,000, plus the nine weeks of time. I think I&#39;ve learned enough over the last 14 months to get a job as an entry level developer. If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;ll be out 6k and I&#39;ll know I gave it my best shot. Then I&#39;ll pack my bags, head for the mountains, and become a ski bum (who codes nights and weekends). </p>

<p>Just kidding...kinda. </p>

<h2>Three Things I Know and Two I Don&#39;t</h2>

<h3>Things I know going forward:</h3>

<p>I love to learn, and I&#39;m constantly striving to become a better developer. Day in. Day out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been writing code every day for over a year. I can count on two hands how many days have gone by where I haven&#39;t written a single line of code. </p>

<p>I need a job.</p>

<h3>Things I don&#39;t know:</h3>

<p>If anyone wants to hire me. </p>

<p>Lots more stuff. </p>

<h2>A Word on Bootcamps in General</h2>

<p>To my knowledge, Dev Bootcamp was the first bootcamp-style immersive program. A few students from their first cohort ended up starting their own schools. Now, there&#39;s a programming bootcamp coming to every major city near you. They&#39;re popping up everywhere. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole movement for people learning to code. I think people should learn to code, if only so they have a better understanding of how things work. I avidly believe that coding should be taught in schools, starting in elementary. But, just because it&#39;s taught in schools doesn&#39;t mean we all need to become programmers. Math is taught in school but I don&#39;t want to be a mathematician. I can write, but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to be a writer. Someone can learn to code, but that doesn&#39;t mean they want/need/have to be a programmer. </p>

<p>This next part is pure speculation: I think the percentage of people graduating from these programs and getting jobs is probably dropping. Dev Bootcamp put up some amazing numbers last year, but they haven&#39;t released any since then. I honestly hope they&#39;ve just switched to only reporting yearly job placement rates, and 85% of their students are still scoring jobs. I want them to succeed. I&#39;m less concerned about Dev Bootcamp than I am about some of the schools that came after them. I can&#39;t help but think a lot of these other programs are just looking to ride the wave, take in the tuition, and crank out students who may or may not be adequately prepared. </p>

<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ve rented an apartment in San Francisco for the month of October. If we like it there, we&#39;ll stay longer. If we don&#39;t, then the options are limitless. I couldn&#39;t say that before.</p>

<p>See you in San Francisco. </p>
