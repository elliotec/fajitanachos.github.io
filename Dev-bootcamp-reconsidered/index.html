    <body class="Dev-bootcamp-reconsidered Dev-bootcamp-reconsidered_index">
             <p>In January of 2013 I applied to Dev Bootcamp. To make a <a href="http://fajitanachos.com/Dev-Bootcamp">long story</a> short, I&#39;ve been accepted into the October 7th, cohort. It&#39;s a great opportunity for me to become a full-time developer.There&#39;s one thing holding me back though:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve decided not to go. </p>

<h2>Why Dev Bootcamp?</h2>

<p>When I first applied to Dev Bootcamp, I had <a href="https://github.com/FajitaNachos/Quick-Preview">one project</a> under my belt, and this blog was only a few months old. I didn&#39;t know very much, but I knew that I loved doing this. I also knew just enough to start putting some projects together, learning as I went along. I saw Dev Bootcamp as my ticket to getting a job as a developer. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll go in as a beginner, come out with some chops, and then someone will hire me. I mean, 90% of their graduates have jobs…&quot; I thought to myself, maybe a few times too many.</p>

<p>Dev Bootcamp is the OG. As far as I&#39;m concerned, they started the programming bootcamp movement. It&#39;s the most reputable and well established program out there. I applied with them for one main reason, to get a job. Dev Bootcamp will tell you they won&#39;t guarantee a job, just &#39;kick ass training&#39;. While that may be true, the majority of the applicants are going there to get a job. That&#39;s why people people put up the 12k + living expenses. It&#39;s for that 90% number that was so oft quoted last year.</p>

<h2>Look! A table.</h2>

<p>Pertinent details --  I&#39;ve already paid Dev Bootcamp 11k, $1000 of which constitutes a non-refundable deposit. I consider the full 11k already spent. I&#39;m estimating minimum living expenses at 3k a month. For two people I say that&#39;s pretty fair, if on the low side. </p>

<p>On October 1st</p>

<table id = "dbc-grid">
  <tr>
    <td>
      Don't do dev bootcamp 
      And get a job in the next 6 to 8 weeks

      +$10,000 tuition refund 
      + 9 weeks of my time and effort
      - 6000 living expenses for 2 months
      + a job

      additional outlay = 0
      total cost = 6k (paid for with the dev bootcamp refund)

      WIN
    </td>
    <td> 
      Do dev bootcamp
      And get a job 6 to 8 weeks after the program ends

      +$3000 refund from DBC for getting a job
      - living expenses during and after DBC (12k)
      + a job

      Additional outlay = 9k
      total cost = 21k

      WIN 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Don't do devbootcamp
      Don't get a job

      +10,000 tuition refund
      + 4000 two months living expenses
      +9 weeks of my time and effort

      - a job

      additional costs = 0
      total costs = 6k (paid for with the dev bootcamp refund)

      DRAW 
    </td>
    <td>
      Do dev bootcamp
      And don't get a job

      -6,000 living expenses
      -9 weeks of time
      -lots of self confidence

      - a job

      Additional outlay = 12k
      total cost = 23k
      EPIC FAILURE 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Obviously scenario #4 is catastrophic, not just for me, but anyone going through Dev Bootcamp. That&#39;s not something that is easy to bounce back from. #2 and #3 are somewhere in the middle. #2 is a win, because I&#39;ll have a job, I&#39;ll have picked up some more skills during the program, it&#39;d be a lot of fun, but it would also be expensive. Worth it, yes, expensive, yes. #3 was interesting to look at. I couldn&#39;t call it a failure because there were too many positives to it. I labeled it a draw because I won&#39;t have a job, which sucks, but I&#39;ll still have 10k and 9 weeks of my life. Also, if I can&#39;t get a job on my own, after doing this for a year, I&#39;m not sure how much Dev Bootcamp could have done for me. #1 is where the magic happens. That&#39;s not true. This is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>but #1 is the best possible situation. Looking at the 4 options, I decided to aim for the best one. If I fail, all I&#39;m out is 6k and I&#39;ll know I gave it my best shot. Then I&#39;ll pack my bags, head for the mountains, and become a ski bum. Just kidding...kinda. </p>

<p>Do You Really Want It?</p>

<p>I have more programming experience than most of the people who would have been in my cohort. That&#39;s generally not a problem. We all have to start somewhere and there&#39;s no prior programming experience required at Dev Bootcamp. Which is great. What I&#39;m more concerned about than experience, is the drive. </p>

<p>As of today the waiting list for dev bootcamp is already 6 months deep. I assume for most people the appeal of Dev Bootcamp is that it&#39;s an intensive course, crammed into 9 weeks. Which is a short time. But if you have to wait 6 months before you start, why don&#39;t you just start learning to code now? You&#39;ll be better prepared to attend Dev Bootcamp when the time comes, or you may decide it&#39;s not for you, for whatever reasons. I think it&#39;s almost criminal, though, to wait until you receive prep work from whatever bootcamp you are attending before you start learning to code. I know we are all busy, but if you really want to do this, you&#39;ll find the time. </p>

<p>Some Things I Know and Two I Don&#39;t</p>

<p>Things I know going forward:</p>

<p>I love to learn, and I&#39;m constantly striving to become a better dev. Day in. Day out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been writing code everyday for over a year. I can count on two hands how many days have gone by where I haven&#39;t written a single line of code. My wife can too...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve built things</p>

<p>I want to love going to work</p>

<p>I need a job</p>

<p>Things I don&#39;t know:</p>

<p>If anyone wants to hire me. </p>

<p>Lots more stuff. </p>

<p>Other Bootcamps</p>

<p>There are Dev Bootcamp copycats popping up everywhere now. If all of these are as well run as Dev Bootcamp, it&#39;d be a great thing. But I&#39;m sure they aren&#39;t and I fear it&#39;s going to dilute the quality/reputation of anyone who graduates from a programming bootcamp. If the students graduating from these programs, aren&#39;t serious about coding, and are just looking for a job, then the overall bar is going to be lowered. I&#39;m sure all it takes is an employer giving one person from a coding bootcamp a shot, it going south, and then they disregard the next person who applies after coming through a bootcamp. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too mainstream now. I think previously, a year or so ago, Dev Bootcamp was still relatively unknown outside of the tech world. Now, it&#39;s still not mainstream but it&#39;s getting closer and at the same time I think the quality of the applicants is dropping. I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t accepting great people, and
Programming Bootcamps in General</p>

<p>First there was Dev Bootcamp, then there was … and … and …  Now there&#39;s one coming to a major city near you, every major city. The good aspect of that is that more people who want to learn how to code, can apply and maybe get in. But there&#39;s plenty of other ways to learn to code. Which is also why this is bad. I feel like the best developers, will be the ones who are innately passionate about it, and are already learning on their own. They may go through a bootcamp for a final push to get them to the next level. But I&#39;m afraid that will the onslaught of new programming bootcamps, who needs students tuition to pay the bills, will result in people being taken advantage of and at the same time, the general quality of new developers applying for jobs will suffer. If someone is serious about coding, I would expect them to be learning on their own and using a bootcamp as a launching off point, not as a starting point. I just remember a post about bootcamps being better at an end of a career instead of the beginning. When I read that 6 months ago, I didn&#39;t get it. I definitely get it now. </p>

<p>What&#39;s next?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. The plan is to head to San Francisco on October 1st. We&#39;ll be there for sure until October 31st. If we like it, we&#39;ll stay longer. If I can find a job, we&#39;ll stay longer. If not, I may wind up in Seattle, Portland, or a little cabin in the woods. </p>
